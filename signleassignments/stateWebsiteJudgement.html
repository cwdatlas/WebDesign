<!-- Alaska-->
<div class="states">
  <h1>Alaska's Website</h1>
  <h2>positives</h2>
  <p>Overall I found the Alaskan site to be very easy to move around, easy to understand what is there.
    for instance I could easily see important topics on the right hand side of the screen with included
    pictures on the buttons, I really liked how easy that made it to see and distiquish.
    Other than easy to see and navigate I though it looked good and had a traditional layout.
  </p>
  <h2>Negetives</h2>
  <p>There isn't much bad about this site. The big one is that its elements arent set to percentages
    so it wont work well on small screens. The other, not as important issue, was that it looked out
    of date, like it was made 10 or 15 years ago. I think it would be very important to keep a Website
    up to date which insures that users that the info is also up to date.

<!-- Arkansas-->
<div class="states">
  <h1>Arkansas's Website</h1>
  <h2>positives</h2>
  <p>This site is slick with modern that uses the entire screen. It even can work with diffrent sized screens!
    In addition it has modern graphics whith moving parts and tabs. It's really "Alive". Overall it's A
    great website that designers should take after.
  </p>
  <h2>Negetives</h2>
  <p>I found the Alaskan site to be easier to navigate do to how simple and small it is. A person
    doesn't have to scroll through that site and they can find most of what they are looking for.
    The Arkansas site should work to be more apparent in what each button by using pictures that
    relate to that thing more than using text to describe that button.

<!-- Kansas-->
<div class="states">
  <h1>Kansas's Website</h1>
  <h2>positives</h2>
  <p>The Kansas site is an interesting one. It can form to whatever screen a person has, its nice and modern, and
    it has a fantastic searching ability. It looks very pretty overall, and is simplistic. There arent many pros here as there
    isnt much on the main page.
  </p>
  <h2>Negetives</h2>
  <p>The site is, I would say, too simplistic. The main page ONLY has a search bar with a couple links on the
    bottom and a covid link at the top. A person has to search to find everything they are wanting to find.
    Also the "Get Answers" button should be easier to read, personaly I find the currsive a bit much.
    Overall, I believe the site should have more links to very common places on the main screen, but
    keep it simplistic as that is its stregth.

<!-- Maine-->
<div class="states">
  <h1>Maine's Website</h1>
  <h2>positives</h2>
  <p>I would say that site is the best site I have seen yet. It is simple, though not too, it is modern and easy to follow
    and it looks nice, though I might choose a diffrent main color than white. This website works great on my phone, though
    it got kinda weird when I changed the window width on my laptop down far. The search bar even has "trending"
    topics on it for a person to just click. it combines the best from all the sites ive seen previously. The one site to
    rule them all if you will.
  </p>
  <h2>Negetives</h2>
  <p> I really dont have much of an issue with this site at all. The small issues like color, not having a dark mode,
    or in weird sercumstances it doesnt work, but other than that its a great site.

<!-- Maryland-->
<div class="states">
  <h1>Maryland's Website</h1>
  <h2>positives</h2>
  <p>Mayrland's site is quite nice with a good color scheam, lots of information, easy ways to look up that info and a modern
    look and is able to be on many screen sizes. Again the search bar has a quick look up selection. THe coolest thing
    I though I saw on this site was how it was integrated with google map system so a person can find state agencies quickly and easily.
    Overall a good solid site
  </p>
  <h2>Negetives</h2>
  <p>This site, I believe, failes at the same thing the Karkansas site did, Its too noisy. it has too much stuff around with
    not simplistic labeling for each one. There are even points where I though the site didn't
    go lower because of a band of red wen across the screen with links. That deseign is usually at the bottom of main pages.
    Overall it was noisy with a confusing at times layout.

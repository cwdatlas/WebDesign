          <a href="https://www.anime-fumetsunoanatae.com/en/characters/"><h2>To Your Eternity Character site</h2></a>
          <p> The site for the anime "To Your Eternity" has a surprisingly advanced website
          with responsive assets like picture frames and a loading in screen that enphasises the show.
        I particularly like it because of its simple desiegn that takes up the entire screen, and it
      even works with mobile. I cant seem to be able to access the HTML, but the css looks clean and modern. </p>
      <p>The main pictures on the site are able to be clicked, then a more detailed set of info pops up.
      This suggests that the use of javascript is in use and the images are some sort of button. This use of
    pop ups is a great way to keep things simple while also being able to display a lot of data. I have not seen
  another site quite like this one in now smooth and interactive it is.</p>
  <p>The color desiegn is also great as its color choice is mostly black and white with a dash of gold. The choice
  to have the color desiegn so simple allows the colors of the characters to take presidence.</p>
  <p>After validation there were three warnings that popped up. One of these warnings appares to be valid. This
  warning is "the charset attrebute on the script element is obsolete". The other two issues appear to be more of
 a desiegn choice like "header is empty"</p>
 <p>Overall this site is exceptional with interactive and simplistic desiegn that can state all the informaiton it needs to</p>

          <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/1920s-america/a/movies-cinema-sports-1920s"><h2>Khan Acadimy</h2></a>
          <p>Next, is the Khan Academy site. This site looks clean with a color palet of blue and white, nice and simple there.
          There is a nice navication colomn on the left which gives out handy info about where you are on the site. The site even
        has a massive veriety of languages that it can be viewed in, the last site only had english and japanese. Also, the sites
      has a header included which shows the logo, which is also nice and simple. There is also a search in that header and a couple
    other buttons.</p>
    <p>The biggest issue with this site is its validation results. After 213+ issues I decided to start writing this. The site does
    not follow the guidlines at all, but as the site working well and displays valuable information effectivly I wont state that
  this site is a bad one in particular. Though it certainly isnt as good as the To Your Eternity site. </p>
  <p>Overall the Khan academy site is a good site for learning as it is simplistic with lots of info, but it doesnt follow W3C validation.
  I would say that this site works, but it would be far better is it was following W3C guidlines.</p>

        <div class="siteBox">
          <a href="https://www.ponggame.org/"><h2>Pong Site</h2><a>
          <p>The third site is the Pong site. This site is a historcal documentation sort of site where a person can play pong, and other games, and learn about them
          in the process. The sites code looks fairly simple, and the Validator got 8 errors in the site. The color scheim is black and white
          with a basic template like layout. This site is not fancy. I could set it up other than the game. I dont like the look of this site as
          much as others, like the Khan Academy site, and it certianly isnt as useful as that previous site. The single advantage this site
          over others is it's inclution of games, which all seem to run well. I found it strange how the HTML was modern, I recognized more
          on this site than I did on the To Your Eternity site. I attrubite this to this site's simplisity.</p>
          <p>The Pong.gov site is simple with little design put into itself. It has a use as a learning tool and a way to have fun, but
          other than that it is basic, too basic to be ranked over any other site on this list.</p>

      <h2>What is there to do on Venus?</h2>
      <p>You can go to the Aphodite Mountains where you will be able to see the first sparks of life flurishing across the range. You might
      even be able to spot the ecologists introducing a new species into the enviroment! How Cool! You will be able to walk through the new groves
      of trees and flowers never seen on any other planet created by the proud members of Roanoke Genetics. Notice the bright colors all of the plants are,
      this is a procaution to limit light obsorbion so the plants dont wither and die from the high light intencities. Make sure to use sunscreen!</p>

      <p class="quote">"Now that Earth is flooded and too hot for its past plant species its great to see a lush place again! The flowers are so bright
        and colorfull! It all took my breath away the first time I saw it! I made sure to register my place in line at Roanoke Construction to get
        a home here on Venus" -Jhon Rockefeller (owner of Earth Mining)</p>

      <h2>What is there to do on Murcury?</h2>
      <p>With the massive sun 2.5 times larger than what it looks on earth burns over the great seas of Murcury! After Roanoke Mining and Refining
      greaciously placed the seas and beaches we quickly seized the oportunity to set up a wonderful vacation hub just for you. The bleached white
      sands insure a fall body tan and the water is a great turquoise from the refining process, how bold to protest against the system government and
      leave in the beautiful colors in the water! If you would be more intereste in the secrets under the water then you can grab scubba gear
      and check out the relecs from years past! increadible! If you happen to be scared of some sea creatures, you dont have to worry, Roanoke Genetics
      hasnt been successful as of yet to introduce any organism into the oceans.</p>

      <p class="quote">The waves are huge man, the low grav really allows for a good time on the water! Sometimes when the water is low you can walk out to
      artifacts used to mine the planet. Really cool. Even the dudes out there loved the artifacts so much they were packing them up and taking them home!

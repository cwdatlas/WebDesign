        <p>HostGator is a website hosting service, but more geared tward long term users, so they have plans that can easily scail with
          what the user would like. It's more for business use than HostWind, and is cheaper with mostly the same atrebutes. These
          are three diffrent services at thier lowest teir to give an idea of the diverse
          market HostGator provides to.

              HostGator has unlimited bandwidth for all services, and has far more comprehensive services compared to its competitors.
              Shared hosting is a cheap and effective way to have a website for any person.
              The Website builder is a good tool to create and host a website easily and without prior Web Design knowledge

              <p>
                Dreamhost offers more simplistic hosting options for a better price compared with hostgator,
                but a user must go and get a domain separately for their site. The Domain finding process is
                implemented directly into the dreamhost.com website to make things as easy as possible.

        <h2> Favorite </h2>
        <p> There are many options here, but I think the best depends on your situation, firstly, hostwinds doesn't compare on price well compared to the others'
          shared hosting services, so I wouldn't pick host wind even know you get unlimited disk space, bandwidth, and a free domain. I personally would pick
          HostGator as it is built to grow with a website and gears itself tward long term customers, but if someone just wants a small cheap website, go with dreamhost.
          The Word Press site would be easy to build and its very cheap if you choose a cheap domain name.

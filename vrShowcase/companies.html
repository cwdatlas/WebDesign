        <hr>
        <p> There are many companies that are in the VR space, but few that make VR headsets and fiewer that have a large
          market share. The VR headset market is a near monopoly with Oculus/Meta having the vest majority of market share. This topic
          is a hot one, so here is Thrill to give you an introduction to it and what the VR community can do to make sure that
          they keep their privacy and independence from Meta.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>Oculus, the maker of the Oculus Quest and Quest2 and owned by Meta. If you arent up to date Facebook changed their name to Meta.
            Meta has the lionshare of the market share putting them in teritory of a near monopoly esspecially with its appstore and how a person
            needs a facebook account to use their Quest. If you watched the video above you would have found out the general atitude that the
            VR community has in relation to Meta. Buy a quest if you dont have any other options, but make sure to keep up to date so you can
            help in the fight against Meta if needed.</p>

          <hr>
          <p> Valve is a far more friendly company than Meta, but still is monolithic with the second largest in market share in VR headsets.
            That market share is a small fraction of Meta's, but it makes up the more enthusiest community as their headset, yes singular, is
            one of the best headsets in the market aside from exceptionally expensive headsets. They also have the largest game store on PCs, which
            is where you would likely go to play any of your games in SteamVR, their app store's VR launcher.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>htc has been in the tech industry for a long time. Before they made headsets they made phones back before 2010. They sold
            that section of the company and pivitted to VR with their first headset being the htc Vive, my first and primary headset lauched
            back in 2015. Today they are a mildy successful company in the consumer VR headset market, and more successful in the business market.

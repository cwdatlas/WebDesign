          <p> The VR community is a massive and diverse group of people from digital artists to the average Beat Saber player. All of these
          people love the medium no matter how much time they actually spend in it. There are a couple important things to know about the community
          like what goups you might like more. With all the diversity there is a group for you!</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">VR Chat</h1>
          <p>The largest and most expansive community would the VR Chat community, and it would also be the strangest. To get there you will need
          to download and install VR Chat from steam or the oculus store depending on what Headset you are yousing. Go to the headset page to know
          what store you need to use. </p>
          <p>If you like hanging out with people from all over the world then you will like VR chat. I personally have met people from South Korea,
           Brazil, France, Austraila and all around the USA to say the least. The target age audience for this group is usually around 15-30, though
           there are some younger kids on at times.</p>
           <p>There are many places, worlds, in VR chat where you can go at any time. You can even invite your friends there and all hang out. These
           places could have games like pool, disk wars (like tron), and many other games. While in those places you can take pictures with all of yours
          friends. Check out the gallery to see what your missing!</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">Moddeling</h1>
          <img src="images/fenWireframe.PNG" alt="fen wire frame" class="float-end img-fluid col-md-2 m-3">
          <p>To make all of those avatars a person needs to be able to moddel avatars and objects. This is a large part of the VRC community and in extension
          the VR community in general. Moddeling and other topics similar like Unity developement is a massive topic, so I wont go into detail, but I can show
          you a wireframe of my old avatar. As you can see on the wireframe there are many polygons. The Moddeler needs to be able to shape the avatar with those
          polygons, sometimes one by one in the case of objects.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">ThrillSeeker</h1>
          <p>The last community I will be talking about here are the communities around VR youtubers, and specifically ThrillSeeker. </p>

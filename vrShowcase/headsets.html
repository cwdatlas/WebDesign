          <hr>
          <p> If your wanting to get into VR you will need a headset. There are many headsets to choose from, but many of those
          have outdated technology or are priced higher than needed for a persons needs. There are about two headsets that most people
          could buy, the index and the quest. Ill talk more about those headsets and others down below.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">Varjo</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>This Headset is in a leuge of its own. The framerate is high, the pixel dencity is high enough where the screen door effect
          is not pressent. In use for VR it is fantastic, but thats not all. It can be used for increadible AR aswell. All of these pros
          are balanced out with the costs. A person has to have a maxed out PC with two 3080s ontop of the cost around 6000 dollars plus
          a monthly subscription of about 1000 dollars. If you can swing it, it is the best VR headset you can buy.<p>

          <h1 class="display-2">Oculus Quest2</h1>
          <hr>
          <p> The Quest 2, developed by Oculus and owned by Meta is the best price to proformace VR headset. If you want a VR headset
          the best option if you dont have a PC and dont want to spend too much, about 300-400, then the Oculus Quest 2 is the best for you.
          Make sure to remember that depending on when you are seeing this you might need a facebook account to use your Quest.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">Index</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>The index is the flagship high quality VR system having the second largest market share on Steam VR. If you have a good PC
          and have a thousand dollar budget, then this is the VR system for you. Remember that it uses base station tracking allowing for
          better tracking compared to the quest tracking. The controllers that come with the Index are the best controllers out of
          any in the industry with the best hand tracking.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">htc Vive</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>The Vive is the first VR headset on the market, and my daily driver at the moment. Its a great starter VR if you dont
          care too much about how old it is or price to proformace and you have a decent PC. Compared to the quest it has a slight lower
          resolution, but has a higher framerate and doesnt stutter as much. Most of all it can handle more complicated worlds, if your
          PC is good enough.</p>

          <h1 class="display-4">pimax</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>This last one is a strange one. Pimax isn't just one headset but many. There are many variations of pimax headsets
          that specialize in high FOV and high resolution. The newer headsets dont have as mad of distortion on the sides of the
          screen, so those are the ones I would recomend if at all. They also use SteamVR tracking, so base stations are needed.</p>
